    This mod expands the functionality of the Centurion mechanoid by allowing it to act as a proxy commander, similar to a mechanitor. 
    With this mod, players can draft and command mechanoids within the Centurion's command range, enabling more dynamic combat control. 
    Additionally, the Centurion can now fulfill the requirement of having a colonist in a caravan, allowing players to form mechanoid-only caravans. 

    Key Features:
    - Command mechanoids within the Centurion's range, just like a mechanitor.
    - Draft mechanoids for combat directly through the Centurion.
    - Use the Centurion as a colonist proxy to fulfill caravan requirements, enabling mechanoid-only caravans.
    - Optimized code to ensure smooth performance with large modlists and mod compatibility.

    Dependencies:
    - Requires the Biotech DLC.
